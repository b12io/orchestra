Our Motivation
==============

`B12 <http://b12.io/>`_ has open sourced Orchestra as part of our goal to build a brighter future of work.

We are a startup based in NYC that is passionate about improving how people do creative and analytical work. We have a strong team of engineers and designers who have worked extensively on systems that help people work productively online.

Beyond focusing on profit, we believe that the products and experiences we design should be considerate of their greater social context and impact. To stay true to these values, we are in the process of becoming a `B-certified corporation <http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps>`_.
