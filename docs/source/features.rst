Time Tracking
*************

Workers can track time spent on a task using the Timer/Timecard feature. 
The navigation bar in the dashboard and task views has a Timer icon. When clicked on,
a dropdown appears that allows the worker to toggle a Timer. The worker can also
optionally add a description and specify the task they are working on. When the
timer is stopped, a time entry is automatically created for the amount of time
tracked. A worker can go to the Timecard page (TODO: add link?) to edit entries
and manually add time entries.
