Orchestra is a Robotic Process Automation system for orchestrating project teams of experts and machines.
Projects can include everything from design teams working on a client's project
to newsrooms bringing together reporters, photographers, and editors for a
story. In Orchestra workflows, you can assign senior experts to review other
experts in order to provide feedback and iteratively refine the work.
Orchestra also brings machines and automation onto projects: a crawler can
collect content from the web before an expert combs through it, or a classifier
can filter out bad data so an analyst spends less time in the noise.  New
workflows can be added with some simple python glue and an html interface.
