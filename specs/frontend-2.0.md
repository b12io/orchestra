Elena, Elston, Aditya, Ashley, and marcua have all discussed various aspects of Orchestra’s frontend 2.0. Elena speficially has been working on a super-awesome tech spec for bringing us to a modernized React-based codebase. marcua wanted to summarize some ideas he's discussed with Ashley and Aditya that likely won’t change Elena's implementation details, but will likely influence how we prioritize the multiple releases of the implementation.

* In terms of releasing a new Orchestra frontend in pieces, we can release the new Orchestra app at /orchestra2/app/ while maintaining the old one at /orchestra/app/.
* If we do that, we can release newly rewritten screens piece by piece. For example, we can implement the dashboard at /orchestra2/app/, but when you click on a task, it links to /orchestra/app/task/{id} or when you click on project management, it links to /orchestra/app/project/{id}.
* There’s no question we want to reimplement the dashboard (currently AngularJS), project management (currently AngularJS), timer (currently AngularJS), time card (currently AngularJS), available tasks (currently Django-rendered), and settings (currently Django-rendered) in React.
* One open question is whether we want to reimplement the login/password reset screens in React or leave them server-rendered. Aesthetically, I think it would be fine to use React so we can benefit from our design system, but I’m less concerned with moving/reimplementing an authentication backend to work with the frontend. So perhaps the tech spec can include a plan for those pages to look like the rest of the new experience, but without significantly modifying the backend/auth tokens/data model to make it work.
* The most up-in-the-air question in my mind is whether to migrate the task page over. My intuition is that from both an experience and a technical perspective, there are reasons we might not want to migrate it, eliminating the task page entirely:
    * Experience: Internally at B12, we have an effort to centralize all task management inside our product, but call out to the Orchestra API to manage things like to-dos, work assignment, etc. Orchestra is increasingly becoming the place to find work, identify what needs to be done by collaborators, and ensure collaborators have done it, but not the place where the work itself is done. If we were to only design for B12, simply having a list of links on each dashboard task row (e.g., “Editor,” “Project management”) would be enough.
    * Technical: Implementing the bootstrapping code that loads a task screen dynamically depending on its type is the most challenging aspect of the technical design of Orchestra’s frontend. In the 1.0 frontend, this is done in a very inelegant way: the Django template renderer just injects a bunch of includes of stray compiled JS/CSS files to the dashboard HTML whose namespaces easily and frequently collide.
* Rather than definitively deciding whether we will implement task-specific screens in frontend 2.0, here’s a proposal for a way to make progress on a tech spec and on implementation:
    * The tech spec should include: a) The plan for implementing the “There’s no question” bullet above, b) A plan for the aesthetics-only “One open question” bullet above, and c) A plan for how we would implement the task page.
    * Roughly speaking, the task page solution looks like: Create an NPM package `orchestra`, which offers up a root `OrchestraDashboard` component that takes as a prop a mapping of task type to `OrchestraTask` components that can render a custom experience. Orchestra users can then write their own components and have them rendered when someone clicks on a task’s row.
    * When we go to implement the tech spec, we can implement the NPM package to house a, b, and c above. We’ll likely implement just a and b initially, and link to the old task view as we roll out individual components.
    * After some discussion, if we decide it’s valuable to support custom task screens, we’ll implement c. If we decide it’s not valuable, we can still release a bunch of reusable components for items that used to be on the task page (e.g., `TeamInfo` or `TodoList`) so that they can be embedded in other experiences (e.g., at B12, the right pane where work is done) that communicate with the Orchestra API.
